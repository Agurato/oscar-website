I'm a research engineer working on better software to generate, manage and filter [large corpora](https://oscar-corpus.com). I use [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) and [Python](https://python.org) to improve performance and safety of code and generate statistical data about generated corpora. 

I'm interested in bringing more software engineering practices in research software in order to improve performance and reliability.
I am currently employed at the [ALMAnaCH research team](https://team.inria.fr/almanach) at [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en/). 

I like movies, making music and eating falafel üßÜ.

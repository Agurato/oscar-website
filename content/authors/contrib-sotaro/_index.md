I am a Ph.D. student at the [Data and Web Science Group](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/dws/) at the [University of Mannheim](https://www.uni-mannheim.de/en/).

My current interest is automatic summarization systems for research papers. Additionally, to academic side of the field, I also like to develop [webpages](https://sotaro.io/tldrs) and [software](https://github.com/sobamchan/schnitsum).

I love coffee, reading papers and books.

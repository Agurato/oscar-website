## How can I decompress the OSCAR Corpus?

OSCAR is distributed in split files that are compressed in order to save spave. However, some decompression programs have trouble dealing with `gz` files.
Here are some programs that work well depending on OSes:

- OSX/Linux: Use `gzip -d FILE.gz`.
- Windows: Use [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/

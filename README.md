This is the home of the OSCAR website!

We're trying to translate our website to every language possible so that we can make our corpus as accesible as possible. If you want to contribute please open a pull request.

OSCAR's website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the beautiful [Academic Theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).

OSCAR itself was put together by [Pedro J. Ortiz](https://pjortiz.com/), [Benoît Sagot](http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/) and [Laurent Romary](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/laurentromary).

Our beautiful mascot was designed by the talented [Alix Chagué](https://twitter.com/Alix_Tz).

## Opening a Pull Request

If you want to help us translate our website and you have experience with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) just fork our repo, create a folder for the target language within the content directory and make a pull request. For more information see the Hugo documentation [here](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/)

If you don't have any experience with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) you can still help by opening an issue and pasting the translation of the text you see on the website there.

We will tri to translate the big table in the download section automatically, but for the moment we do not have a solution for every language, so if you can, please translate some of the language names in the table.

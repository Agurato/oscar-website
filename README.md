This is the home of the OSCAR website!

We're trying to translate our website to every language possible, so if you want to contribute please open a pull request.

OSCAR's website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the beautiful [Academic Theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).

OSCAR itself was put together by [Pedro J. Ortiz](https://pjortiz.com/), [Benoît Sagot](http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/) and [Laurent Romary](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/laurentromary).

Our beautiful mascot was designed by the talented [Alix Chagué](https://twitter.com/Alix_Tz).

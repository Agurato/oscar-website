This is the home of the OSCAR website!

OSCAR's website was built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the beautiful [Academic Theme](https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic).

OSCAR itself was put together by [Pedro Ortiz Suarez](https://pjortiz.eu/), [Julien Abadji](https://ujj.space), [Benoît Sagot](http://alpage.inria.fr/~sagot/), and [Laurent Romary](https://cv.archives-ouvertes.fr/laurentromary).

Our beautiful mascot was designed by the talented [Alix Chagué](https://twitter.com/Alix_Tz).
